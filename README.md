The Multiple Linear Regression Model works as its own file as basketball_linear_reg.py, it just needs to access a csv file to train off of and a csv file to test off of, which can be altered in the code
and by using the provided csv files. It prints out a number that represents how accurate it was in predicting the overall outcome of the games it tested and a graph that
shows the predicted vs actual results

The Decision Tree Classifier was written in Google Colab, a Jupyter Notebook development environment. This raw code was used to perform all tasks involving the decision tree classifier. To run, there may be some modiciations that need to be made depending on development environment, so click the link provided by Google Colab to access the original portal and upload the csv files given above to start working.
