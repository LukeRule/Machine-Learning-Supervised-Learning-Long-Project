Long Supervised Learning Project by Luke Rule and Tim Gehrsitz

The Multiple Linear Regression Model works as its own file, it just needs to access a csv file to train off of and a csv file to test off of, which can be altered in the code
and by using the provided csv files. It prints out a number that represents how accurate it was in predicting the overall outcome of the games it tested and a graph that
shows the predicted vs actual results
